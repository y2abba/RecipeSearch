# RecipeSearch
I made a React web application that provides a recipe search engine.
For example, if the user would like to find a recipe to make brownies,
they would simply input the keyword brownies, and would be prompted with several recipes
they could use.

For this project, I used the React web application, along with an API to pull recipe data for the query.
I then presented the data into a simple web App as follows!
